        <h1 style="text-align: center">Sigh.</h1>
        <p>If you're anything like me, you worked in the great world of Flex. We had great frameworks, like Swiz and Robotlegs. We had an IDE
        that was as good as its Eclipse container allowed it to be. We had an awesome community.</p>
        <p>And then Adobe went and screwed it all up. Now you're likely looking at JavaScript, and it's not pretty.  That's why I cobbled together this little toolkit.</p>
        <p>fury.js, combined with tools like Knockout, is how I'm writing JavaScript-based apps using the same architectures
        that I used with Swiz:  controllers, presentation models, service delegates, injections, bindings.  They're all there
        with just a little help from fury.js.</p>
        <p>Here's a quick guide, just for you folks who speak MXML, aimed mostly at the Swiz dialect.</p>
    </div>


      <h2>[Inject]</h2>
      
      <p>Ahh, [Inject].  You asked, and your bean was delivered.  fury.js has an equivalent, and you don't need to worry about
      wacky "Oops, I called inject() on instantiation, but I hadn't registered the dependency yet!" kind of stuff.  fury.js
      handles late-binding of dependencies just fine.</p>
      
      <p>Where you would write:</p>

      <pre>[Inject] public var service : SomeService</pre>

      <p>fury.js lets you write:</p>

      <pre>fury.inject( this, "someService", someService )</pre>

      <p>Inside that class that is "this," you'll get a property named "someService" that is the bean registered as "someService."  This
      should sound awfully familiar.</p>

      <p>Going further, you can have something happen right after injection takes place:</p>

      <pre>fury.inject( this, "someService", someService, function() {
    console.log( "someService was injected into:" );
    console.log( this ); // note that "this" is resolved correctly!
}</pre>

      <h2>[EventHandler]</h2>

      <p>The core of it all, letting you escape the tree that was the displaylist and enter the realm of good MVC. A lot of
      JavaScript I see doesn't acknowledge this yet, so fury.js provides a central event dispatcher much like really
      early Swiz (later replaced by the application itself!).  Whereas most other JavaScript "pub/sub" frameworks rely
      on global-level event handlers, fury.js assumes your event handlers are located within an instance a freestanding, independent instance
      of a class (e.g. a controller).</p>
      <p>If that made no sense, let me put it this way:  most JavaScript event frameworks act like you defined your handlers
      within your top-level MXML application file, and then you dug into your entire view tree to take action.</p>

      <p>Where you would write:</p>

      <pre>[EventHandler( event="GreetingEvent.SAY_HI", properties="message") ]
public function sayHi( message : String ) : void
{
    // stuff
}         
</pre>

      <p>fury.js lets you write:</p>

      <pre>fury.subscribe( "greeting.sayHi", this, function( message ) {
    // stuff
});</pre>
      
      <h2>dispatchEvent( event )</h2>
      
      Back in 2000 or so, Flash's event system opened my eyes to a new world of development.  It led to me writing Model-Glue,
      which really jumpstarted my career.  It's the core of how we build good Flex applications, so I had to have it
      in JavaScript-land.
      
      <p>Where you would write:</p>
      
      <pre>dispatcher.dispatchEvent( new GreetingEvent( GreetingEvent.SAY_HI, "Hi mom!" ) );</pre>
      
      <p>fury.js lets you write:</p>
      
      <pre>fury.publish( "greeting.sayHi", "Hi Mom!" );</pre>

      <p>That second argument can be anything, so you can do fun things like:</p>

      <pre>fury.publish( "contact.save", { firstName : "Mark", lastName: "Weir"} );</pre>

      <p>Or, if you choose to use the "M" part of "MVC":</p>

      <pre>fury.publish( "contact.save", new Contact( 'Steve', 'Peat' ) );</pre>

      <h2>BeanProvider.as</h2>

      Yeah, it was really nice to define beans in MXML and all that good stuff.  Nothing quite that elegant exists
      in JavaScript (yet), so fury.js provides a simple way to register a bunch of beans at once.

      <p>Where you would write:</p>

      <pre>&lt;service:ContactService /&gt;
&lt;control:ContactController /&gt;
&lt;pm:ContactEditorPresentationModel /&gt;
</pre>

      <p>fury.js lets you write:</p>

      <pre>fury.register({
    contactService : new ContactService(),
    contactController : new ContactController(),
    contactEditorPresentationModel : new ContactEditorPresentationModel(),
})</pre>


      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      
      <p>I've rewritten the Knockout port of TodoMVC to use fury.js and the nearly standard "model, controller, presentation model, service"
      setup we use in Swiz applications.  Its <a href="https://raw.github.com/joeRinehart/furyjs/master/samples/todos/js/todos_fury.js">big
      ugly JavaScript file</a> is annotated with an eye towards Swiz developers, and the <a href="http://joerinehart.github.com/furyjs/todomvc/index.html">full application</a> is
      available as part of fury.js' Git repository.</p>
